        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Mohd Harish, and I am a third-year student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at PSIT. I have a passion for developing cutting-edge technologies that can change the world, and I am excited to connect with professionals in the industry to learn and grow as a computer engineer.
            During my studies, I have gained a strong foundation in both hardware and software engineering. I have also gained hands-on experience through an internship at NullClass, where I have been able to apply my knowledge and develop my skills in Full-Stack Web Development.
            I am particularly interested in problem-solving and web development, and I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to explore this field further. I am a dedicated and hardworking individual with strong problem-solving skills, and I enjoy collaborating with others to find innovative solutions to complex problems.
             I am excited about the possibilities that the future holds for computer engineering, and I am eager to contribute to this field in any way I can</p>
